# ZED Native Object Detection Configuration
# ========================================

zed_object_detector:
  # Detection Model Options:
  # - MULTI_CLASS_BOX_ACCURATE: Best accuracy, slower (recommended for URC)
  # - MULTI_CLASS_BOX_FAST: Faster detection, lower accuracy
  # - PERSON_HEAD_BOX_ACCURATE: Person detection only, high accuracy
  # - PERSON_HEAD_BOX_FAST: Person detection only, fast
  # - CUSTOM_BOX_OBJECTS: Custom trained model
  detection_model: "MULTI_CLASS_BOX_ACCURATE"
  
  # Tracking and Performance
