# DRIVE TO POSE ACTION
# =============================================================================
# Action for driving the rover to a target pose with path planning and
# execution monitoring. Includes URC-specific features like autonomy timer
# and visual servoing for final approach.

# GOAL
geometry_msgs/PoseStamped target_pose      # Target pose in map frame
float32 max_velocity 1.0                  # Maximum velocity during approach (m/s)
float32 position_tolerance 0.1            # Position tolerance for success (meters)
float32 orientation_tolerance 0.1         # Orientation tolerance for success (radians)
float32 timeout 60.0                      # Execution timeout (seconds)
bool use_visual_servoing false            # Enable visual servoing for final 3m
string mission_mode "exploration"         # Mission mode: exploration, science, return_to_base
bool reverse_allowed false                # Allow reverse driving if needed
float32 approach_velocity 0.5             # Velocity for final approach (m/s)
